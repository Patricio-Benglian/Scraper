## WIP Scraper.

Currently does not actually get the html from intranet, you have to download it manually and pass it into the program. (Authentication issues)

## How to use it
- Right click intranet page, click 'save as' and save it as 'test.txt'. 
- Drag file to same location as scraper.py.
- Run scraper.py

If it fails to grab a prototype, it will apologize.
Any other failures, I'm still not sure what it will do.

### Uses Beautiful Soup for parsing html efficiently. 
Installation: 

`sudo pip3 install beautifulsoup4`

## Progress:
I've managed to:

- Create Working File with prototype

## Still haven't managed to:
- Parse main file content and name from example
- Probably utilize exceptions

## Probably easy to do but not done yet:
- Create the files with the correct content
- Remove spaghetti code
- Add sauce to spaghetti code
