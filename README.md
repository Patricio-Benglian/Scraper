## WIP Scraper.

Currently does not actually get the html from intranet, you have to download it manually and pass it into the program. (Authentication issues)

### Uses Beautiful Soup for parsing html efficiently. 
Installation: 

`sudo pip3 install beautifulsoup4`

## Progress:
I've managed to:

- Find Filenames
- Find Prototypes

## Still haven't managed to:
- Separate main files
- Gather main file content
- Group filenames, prototypes, main files (with contents) by task

## Probably easy to do but not done yet:
- Create the files with the correct content
- Remove spaghetti code
